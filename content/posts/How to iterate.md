In order to iterate successfuly, you need to have a well defined problem.

It is important that this problem is not an abstraction. If you are solving a problem for others, you need to talk closely with them.

A modern hammer was not designed by thinking it should be used to hit something hard. It was designed by thinking about what's needed to hammer in a nail at the right speed and angle. Go from the fundaments to a more specialized approach. In order to go through this process, you need to have a well-defined target (problem).
